# Dancer and Dance Instructor

I used to be a competitive ballroom dancer, now I am a Salsa and Kizomba dancer and instructor. I travel all around Europe and the world to explore and exchange ideas and share a wonderful time on the dancefloor with many international salsa dancers and teachers.

I teach regular classes in Münster at [HSP Münster][hsp-salsa] and at [Mambolatinjazz Osnabrück][mambolatinjazz]. I am also booked for workshops on some socials and congresses as well as in other dance schools: [References][references].

## History

I started dancing in the late 90s and quickly moved on to competitive ballroom dancing in [Die Residenz Münster][resi]. Together with my partners I danced on several regional and national championships with mixed results. ;-) We were also member of the federal state team and attended quite a few world ranking competitions.

I quit ballroom dancing in late 2010 for personal reasons and immediately started dancing socially on salsa events in Münster. I also attended three [classes][hsp-salsa] at once, including three beginner classes in a row and started teaching after less than one year. Although it is usually not a great idea to teach that early, my experience in dancing and teaching ballroom helped me to communicate my ideas confidently.

As a ballroom dancer one has quite a different impression of salsa dancing than a regular salsa "consumer". With a strong background in technique and pushing expression to the maximum, normal salsa movements (even in shows) seem to be not so sophisticated and impressive. It takes a while to discover the unique and rich body of history, music, different styles and even different techniques inside the same style. I experienced that it's a matter of luck and personal investment to find the teachers who give the right information in the right moment. ... one's own way to understanding and personal development
