# Computer Science Education Research

I work as a research assistant and PhD student at the Computer Science Department of [Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster][wwu] in the [working group of Prof. Dr. Jan Vahrenhold][agv] (Efficient Algorithms and Algorithm Engineering).

As a member of the [Committee on European Computing Education][cece], a joint project of [ACM Europe][acm-e] and [Informatics Europe][ie], I helped gathering data regarding informatics and digital literacy in European schools. I also built a collaborative [map][cece-map] for visualization and world-wide access to this data. The data will also be published in a report targeting decision makers.

At the department I work on informatics tutor (teaching assistants) education and try to learn from informatics teacher education in this context. I also coordinate and support project seminars and lectures of the group.

# Dancer and Dance Instructor

I started dancing in the late 90s and quickly moved on to competitive ballroom dancing in [Die Residenz Münster][resi]. Together with my partners I danced on several regional and national championships with mixed results. ;-) We were also members of the federal state team and attended quite a few world ranking competitions.

I quit ballroom dancing in late 2010 for personal reasons and immediately started dancing socially on salsa events in Münster. I also attended three [classes][hsp-salsa] at once, including three beginner classes in a row and started teaching after less than one year. Although it is usually not a great idea to teach that early, my experience in dancing and teaching ballroom helped me to communicate my ideas confidently.

As a ballroom dancer one has quite a different impression of salsa dancing than a regular salsa "consumer". With a strong background in technique and pushing expression to the maximum, normal salsa movements (even in shows) seem to be not so sophisticated and impressive. It takes a while to discover the unique and rich body of history, music different styles and even different techniques inside the same style. I experienced that it's a matter of luck and personal investment to find the teachers who give the right information in the right moment. ... one's own way to understanding and personal development
