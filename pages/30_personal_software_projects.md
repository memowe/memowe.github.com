# Personal Software Projects

For fun and for learning purposes, I work on several side projects. This is not meant to be an advertisement for my readers to read or use these. But it's a part of me and if you are curious, feel free to have a look. :-)

- **[Contenticious][contenticious]** ([Repository][contenticious-repo]) is a very simple file-system based content management system on top of the fabulous Perl web framework [Mojolicious][mojolicious]. It is able to either serve the resulting website or can generate static web content. [This site][site-repo] is also generated by Contenticious, via [Travis CI][travis], hosted on [GitHub Pages][gh-pages].
- **[PerLisp][perlisp]** is a statically-scoped lisp interpreter written in Perl which is able to run a dynamically-scoped lisp interpreter written in lisp which is able to run itself inside PerLisp. It also features some non-standard features, for example auto-currying (inspired by Haskell). For the German Perl magazine I wrote an article about how it could be a good idea to develop a programming language interpreter by yourself.
- **Clerical twitter services** - inspired by the one and only [@big_ben_clock][bbc] (which is awesome, but not in my timezone) I built a [web service][tweethour] in 2009 that allows twitter users to make their accounts tweet like a clock (example: [@frauenkirche_dd][frauenkirche]). I used the same web service to bring some local and important german churches to life on twitter. In terms of publicity the [@koelner_dom][koelner_dom] was the most successful one (about 13200 followers in September 2017). The story was featured by at least one big German TV station (on twitter, but ... TV station!), [Cologne's most important newspaper][ksta] on the first page and I even was on air on a local radio station in Cologne. In April 2017, the local cathedral was in the news because the diocese announced it would report my [@paulusdom][paulusdom] account as fake after trying to contact me for three days. The issue was discussed in a local [newspaper][wn1] and finally [dropped][wn2].
- **[REE][REE]** (Regular Expression Engine, *WIP*) is a simple regular expression compiler which offers some inspection. I also wrote a simple [web interface][REE-web] for this engine for better inspection.
- **tGit** (teaching/tiny/toy git, *WIP*) is a version control system framework similar to git, so its core is a hash-based file system. This will be used to explore advanced concepts of the version control universe, for example merging strategies.

There are various other projects not mentioned here.
