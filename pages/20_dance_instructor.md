# Dancer and Dance Instructor

I used to be a competitive ballroom dancer. Now I am a Salsa and Kizomba dancer and instructor. I travel all around Europe and the world to explore and exchange ideas and share a wonderful time on the dancefloor as well as in workshops with many international salsa dancers and teachers.

I teach regular classes in Bielefeld at [Floración Dance & Fitness][floracion], in Osnabrück at [Mambolatinjazz][mambolatinjazz] and in Münster at [HSP Münster][hsp-salsa]. I am also booked for workshops on congresses, as a Salsa DJ on some socials as well as in other dance schools:

## History

I started dancing in the late 90s and quickly moved on to competitive ballroom dancing in [Die Residenz Münster][resi]. Together with my partners I danced on several regional and national championships with mixed results. ;-) We were also members of the federal state team and attended quite a few world ranking competitions.

I quit ballroom dancing in late 2010 for personal reasons and immediately started dancing socially on salsa events in Münster. I also attended three [classes][hsp-salsa] at once, including three beginner classes in a row and started teaching after less than one year. Although it is usually not a great idea to teach that early, my experience in dancing and teaching ballroom helped me to communicate my ideas confidently.
