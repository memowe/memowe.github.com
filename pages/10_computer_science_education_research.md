# Computer Science Education Research

I work as a research associate and PhD student at the Computer Science Department of [Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster][wwu] in the [working group of Prof. Dr. Jan Vahrenhold][agv] (Efficient Algorithms and Algorithm Engineering).

As a member of the [Committee on European Computing Education][cece], a joint project of [ACM Europe][acm-e] and [Informatics Europe][ie], I helped gathering data regarding informatics and digital literacy in European schools. I also built a collaborative [map][cece-map] for visualization and world-wide access to this data. The report was [published][cece-news] in a report targeting decision makers. [It is available online (PDF download)][cece-report].

At the department I work on informatics tutor (teaching assistants) training and try to learn from informatics teacher education in this context. I also coordinate and support project seminars and lectures of the group.
