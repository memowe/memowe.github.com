Title: Software Development in Digital Humanities
navi_name: Digital Humanities

# Digital Humanities

I work as a software developer at the [Service Center for Digital Humanities][scdh] of the [Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster][wwu]. More information will follow soon.

# Former work and research: Computer Science Education

I worked as a research associate at the Computer Science Department of the WWU in the [working group of Prof. Dr. Jan Vahrenhold][agv] (Efficient Algorithms and Algorithm Engineering).

As a member of the [Committee on European Computing Education][cece], a joint project of [ACM Europe][acm-e] and [Informatics Europe][ie], I helped gathering data regarding informatics and digital literacy in European schools. I also built a collaborative [map][cece-map] for visualization and world-wide access to this data. The results were [published][cece-news] in a report targeting decision makers. [It is available online (PDF download)][cece-report].

At the department I not only coordinated seminars and lectures but also worked in the informatics tutor (teaching assistants) training program [KETTI][ketti]. [Learn more... (video)][ketti-video]
