**For fun and recreation** I *work* on several personal software projects ([Read more][PP]). I like flying [RC helicopters][RCH], did half-hearted attempts to become a glider pilot and play some music. I also used to be a sailor and windsurfer. My attempt to stay in shape involves running, swimming and a gym.
