## What I do

**I work as a research associate and PhD student in computer science education at the University of Münster.** I am a member of the Committee on European Computing Education (ACM Europe/Informactis Europe). In the group I work on our tutor training program. [Read more][CSEdR].

**I am a Salsa and Kizomba dancer and instructor.** I do a lot of professional development and travel to many international congresses to improve my dancing and teaching. I teach regular local classes and give workshops on congresses and smaller events. [Read more][Dancing].

**For fun and recreation** I *work* on several personal software projects ([Read more][PP]). I like flying [RC helicopters][RCH], did half-hearted attempts to become a glider pilot and play some music. I also used to be a sailor and windsurfer. My attempt to stay in shape involves running, swimming and a gym.
